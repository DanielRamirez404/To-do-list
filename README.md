# To-do-list

A To-do list C++ CLI application for me to practice linked list implementation

After getting done with my Pokedex project, I decided to grind a few weeks coding this one...
For starters, I tried making a simple doubly linked list class with a few functions, just like some I had already found on the internet.
But right after I fully understood how it was meant to work and refactored all of it to my liking, 
I kept adding more and more functions to give it some of the functionalities that I had forseen I would've ended up wanting to add to the project later on
such as adding/deleting/moving nodes by index or even being able to get a node's value from the [] operator, as if it were an array.

After that, my main focus was on automating the menu using classes, and refactoring code for it to be way more readable. 
In doing so, I learned how to fix some of the problems that were stopping me from using std::string, thus I'm really grateful for it.
I also learned how to work with function pointers, which I find really useful.

After that, the rest of the code got way easier to finish.
